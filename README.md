Using built in `fetch` from Node to handle calling out to external apis

- apparently there is a transaction minimum for bitcoin equivalent to `5460 Satoshis` (is this real) so could potentially add a check to make sure the amount of money we want to buy crypto with meets the minimum values required. Not sure how prevalent this is for other coins, or if that number fluctuates outside of the value of real-world currencies, e.g. 5460 Satoshis could be $10 one day and $20 the next, but does the 5640 number itself ever change?
